Project Structure
My latest #AWS #project where I built a secure network environment using #VPCs #and #VPCpeering! This project involved:
(i) Creating two VPCs: One with public and private subnets for differentiated access control.
(ii) Implementing VPC peering: Enabling secure communication between the VPCs without using the public internet.
(iii)Leveraging AWS services: VPC, EC2, internet gateway, NAT gateway, and route tables to establish a robust network architecture.
->VPC: Virtual Private Cloud - Creates a logically isolated network for your 
AWS resources.
->EC2: Elastic Compute Cloud - Provides virtual servers to run your applications.
->Internet Gateway: Acts as the entry point for internet traffic into your public subnet.
->NAT Gateway: Enables instances in private subnets to access the internet without a public IP address.
->Route Table: Directs traffic within your VPC and to the internet gateway or NAT gateway.
This project demonstrates the power of VPCs and peering for building secure and scalable cloud deployments.
